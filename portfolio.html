        <p class="descripcion">I have been working as a teacher since 2019, having taught people of all ages. What motivates me about my profession is the beauty and satisfaction of teaching and accompanying my students through their various processes, as well as learning from them.
            Regarding my professional development, I regularly participate in webinars and have taken courses not only in areas related to teaching but also on topics of interest, as I enjoy to be continuously learning.
            Besides, I consider myself to be a very organized person, which allows me to optimize my time and maintain a healthy balance between my work and personal life. Additionally, I have good leadership skills and I am able to form solid and meaningful connections with my students.</p><br>
